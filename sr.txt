if snow is drawn on a map improperly (?), _snow.tga might not save
correctly.  The next time the level is opened, trying to draw snow
again will crash the editor.

floating, docked panels

adding a feature and then selecting undo crashes the editor?

Ctrl-Z and Ctrl-Y messages are displayed at the bottom of the main panel

need a general Undo section; this might just be a pointer to other sections:
  undo selected property changes
  undo brush painting
  undo mud (doesn't work)
  restore from archive

U is E-W, V is N-S.

Model - Replace displays the replaced model erratically until one of
the Rebuild options is selected.

Is the editor crashy because I'm abusing it so much, or is it always
crashy?

highlight most useful (non-obvious?) controls (keyboard or mouse)?

During pack, "File not found"
  I had a Sound or SoundDomain that wasn't configured.

How to use this book section:
- sequential, or reference, but be sure to read XXX sections first
- editor is not a consumer-level product; it is debugged mostly only to the extent that Saber used its features to create its maps
  - introduction to bug, tips, design considerations
- if you used MudRunner section

Named properties section can be skipped, but it does give some useful
tips, especially for keyboard shortcuts.

Instead of having a section for "Move a Truck, Model, or Plant",
describe only "move a truck" in the "Trucks" section.  Then refer
to this as necessary when describing how to move a model or plant in
those sections.

Every section of the quick start should have a link to the
corresponding full description.  Possibly it should be right at the
top to grab anyone who clicked the wrong section in the table of
contents.

MaxHeight determines the precision of terrain height.
Terrain height pixels can take on 4096 values.
With MaxHeight="512", height resolution is ~0.125m, about 5 inches.
- should only be used when there are no areas of flattish terrain where the user can build up speed
- perfectly flat terrain is OK, e.g. an ice lake
MaxHeight="128" feels more reasonable.
terrain pixels are about 0.5m on a side

when snow is added to a material without a snow_layer, it simply raises the terrain by the height of the "snow"
when snow is added to a material with a snow_layer, it only raises the height of the snow layer
check "Update Material" in the brush dialog to paint snow_layer material along with the snow depth

can cross references be formatted differently?
- separate their text from surrounding text, similar to the Literal style
- make it obvious that it's a link
not automatically, but if I position the cursor ahead of a reference
and select Edit->Fields, I can use the arrow buttons to quickly step
through all references and manually reformat them.  e.g. do this last.

do some materials suppress mud? (extrudes or automatic)

I can run two copies of the SnowRunner editor at once
  any advantage to that?

breakable ice = IsExtrudable
NoGrass prevents grass from distributions
ice_01 and ice_02 have IsSoil="false"

avoid exposed tall cliffs in the terrain height
  they stretch the texture layer and make it look unnatural

can close the brush dialog box and still get its functions via the keyboard

use 'Terrain Brightness' toolbar button to make it easier to see thin
lines for mud
