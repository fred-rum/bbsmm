How to use this book section:
- sequential, or reference, but be sure to read XXX sections first
- editor is not a consumer-level product; it is debugged mostly only to the extent that Saber used its features to create its maps
  - introduction to bug, tips, design considerations
- if you used MudRunner section

Named properties section can be skipped, but it does give some useful
tips, especially for keyboard shortcuts.
