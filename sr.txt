For Steam, create the minimal "getting started" guide and link to the
main PDF, with links both near the top and the bottom.


if snow is drawn on a map improperly (?), _snow.tga might not save
correctly.  The next time the level is opened, trying to draw snow
again will crash the editor.

floating, docked panels

adding a feature and then selecting undo crashes the editor?

Ctrl-Z and Ctrl-Y messages are displayed at the bottom of the main panel

need a general Undo section; this might just be a pointer to other sections:
  undo selected property changes
  undo brush painting
  undo mud (doesn't work)
  restore from archive

U is E-W, V is N-S.

Model - Replace displays the replaced model erratically until one of
the Rebuild options is selected.

Is the editor crashy because I'm abusing it so much, or is it always
crashy?

highlight most useful (non-obvious?) controls (keyboard or mouse)?

During pack, "File not found"
  I had a Sound or SoundDomain that wasn't configured.

DiffLockType: None, Uninstalled, Installed, Always
Torque: default (always on), full (when AWD enabled), none, connectable (w/ upgrade)
DefaultTire
CompatibleWheels points to an XML file of possible add-on tires

Named properties section can be skipped, but it does give some useful
tips, especially for keyboard shortcuts.

Instead of having a section for "Move a Truck, Model, or Plant",
describe only "move a truck" in the "Trucks" section.  Then refer
to this as necessary when describing how to move a model or plant in
those sections.

Every section of the quick start should have a link to the
corresponding full description.  Possibly it should be right at the
top to grab anyone who clicked the wrong section in the table of
contents.

when snow is added to a material without a snow_layer, it simply raises the terrain by the height of the "snow"
when snow is added to a material with a snow_layer, it only raises the height of the snow layer
check "Update Material" in the brush dialog to paint snow_layer material along with the snow depth

can cross references be formatted differently?
- separate their text from surrounding text, similar to the Literal style
- make it obvious that it's a link
not automatically, but if I position the cursor ahead of a reference
and select Edit->Fields, I can use the arrow buttons to quickly step
through all references and manually reformat them.  e.g. do this last.

do some materials suppress mud? (extrudes or automatic)

I can run two copies of the SnowRunner editor at once
  any advantage to that?

breakable ice = IsExtrudable
NoGrass prevents grass from distributions
ice_01 and ice_02 have IsSoil="false"

avoid exposed tall cliffs in the terrain height
  they stretch the texture layer and make it look unnatural

can close the brush dialog box and still get its functions via the keyboard

use 'Terrain Brightness' toolbar button to make it easier to see thin
lines for mud

when editing zone_settings.json, make a backup before and after your changes.
if the packing process isn't able to read the JSON file properly, it writes
back a "clean" version with all the data missing that it couldn't read.

zones are randomly ordered in the list on the left of the navigation map.
no way to fix their order.

my guide is more accurate and better tested

icon types:
  travel services
  cargo areas
  objectives
  vehicles
  misc

flat:
rounding radius is the radius (in meters) of the center of the boundary line
  inner radius is rounding radius - thickness/2
  outer radius is rounding radius + thickness/2
minimum thickness is equal to the corner radius
  so the inner radius is never less than half the rounding radius

center of line is inset by thickness
  outer edge is inset by thickness * 1/2

thickness is half the specified thickness
  call it breadth?

effects of terrain height on zone ribbon placement

should garage exit be relatively flat?

hypothesis:
  if an unknown ID starts with the same characters as an existing ID,
    the properties are stolen from that ID *even if it still exists*.
-or-
  if an ID is renamed in the main editor, it communicates this to the zone
    settings editor

Azov 73210 + superheavy semi-trailer = ~36 m long
CAT 770G = < 5 m wide

commit property changes (particular ID naming) before opening the zone editor

spurious new campaign start always selects an empty save slot if there is one.
  recommend leaving one open.

How does "recover" work after a gateway crossing?

keyboad shortcuts for the zone settings editor
  e.g. F2 to edit a property string

all flavors of saddle_high can be locked in the garage and/or it can have a price,
  but it is still available and given for free with purchase of a trailer

all flavors of saddle_low cannot be locked in the garage, and it cannot have a price
  and it is always available and given for free with purchase of a trailer

permission denied while packing:
  exit the map in the game

are the various regular zone IDs implicitly on the same map as the primary?
  or can they be on any map, but the global zone ID is needed only so that
  the navigation map can highlight the primary zone?

what happens to spawned cargo when the player leaves the map?

If the same destination zone is used for multiple goals, they share UI Desc:
  truck delivery - yes
  cargo delivery - yes
  others - TBD

what axes does the "Rotation" property group use?
  X ain't X, that's for sure

recover to garage:
  UI_HUD_RECOVERY_NO_ID_IN_EDITOR
  where should a name be set?
    it's not (Terrain)->Description level->ID

troubleshooting:
  if the navigation map shows a pile of text in the upper left corner and
    hangs, check for two zones with the same ID
  ModMapError.txt when loading the map in the game
    definitely used for:
      invalid truck ID in objective
      invalid zone ID in objective
    but doesn't catch all errors

do UIDs of different types need to be different?

redocument behavior of slow asset dialogs

in cargo reference, list the number of individual logs per load

model in Editor is superset of all appearances

static shadows are from finished model
  they're replaced with dynamic shadows as you get closer

figure out what can be changed in a mod that people are already playing
  are changes incorporated into an existing game at all?
    yes
  if something collides with the player's truck, can they recover?
  changes in terrain height? (up or down)
  new models that may collide?
  removed models/plants are always safe?
  touch plant distributions could rearrange plants?
  removed objectives that may be in progress?
  changed truck ID that is being used or was already awarded?
  lock or unlock parts
  add or remove maps from region
  change map to region?
  move zones
  change zones used by objectives
  change zone types added by completed objectives
  add or remove objectives? (check completion progress in profile, too)
  add, change, or remove stages from objective
  are updates at mod.io automatically downloaded and used?

living area goal type is broken?
  or do I just not know how to set it up?

contests
  can contests have any other requirements besides the standard 3?
contracts

(Terrain)->Procedural snow coverage
  affects all trucks at half strength, even the one being driven
    is not applied to glass, interior, wheels, tires
    if a truck has both mud and snow, the mud wins where it is present

"snowy" level affects weather
  requires snow_layer in a material


lights are broken when Dev Tools->Change Time is used
  also when Sky is forced to Night in the map
  flare visible, but lights don't light up other objects or terrain
  light works properly in editor after rebuild terrain
    or in game after natural passage of time

game crashes:
  not if more than 3 employers
  sometimes if custom employer name isn't configured as custom
    icon doesn't matter and is ignored

multi-stage models show only a single model on the navigation map
  (usually their final form)

if objective is not activated, then the user can activate it using the
  same interface as tracking it; activating it then also tracks it
  very strange

Objectives:
  the player has to activate it manually before any progress can be made
  must wait until unlocked to activate
  manual activation also starts tracking
completing the tracked objective
  starts tracking a random other objective


what happens if an objective truck leaves the zone (via a gateway)?
  does it lose its truck ID?
  is it still reserved?
  is it left behind in its new zone if the objective is restarted?

As part of "publish":
  map's *.pak file includes files that look relevant, but aren't
    e.g. all images in ui/textures

bugs to avoid section as part of "publish":
  tasks/contests offered in the same place at the same time


what happens when you continue a game where the map has changed
  trucks are at their moved positions?
  revealed map is as saved?
  mud & ruts?
  objectives are as saved?
  map is changed
    what if height has changed under truck(s)?
      truck falls
      does it get stuck in terrain?
    what if model on top of truck?

clicking away from a paint brush (e.g. Geometry)
  doesn't immediately select the target in the Scene View
  it only de-selects the pain brush
  click again to select the new target
  same in the main panel

editor also has recurring bugs that I can't diagnose the source of.
  these aren't documented.

For every property/bitmap, is it possible to categorize them by when
  the Editor notices updates? e.g.
    RO = read only (not editable)
    NV = not visible
    I = immediate,
    RS = after rebuild selected terrain
    RQ = after rebuild terrain (quick)
    RT = rebuild terrain (full)
  if so, include this info with each property declaration
    e.g. right-justified to the right of the declaration
    colored, and as a hyperlink to an explanation
  some visual features don't have an associated property,
    e.g. static shadows for plants
    how to categorize/document those?
  procedural snow
    I (even after model/plant rotation, etc)
  rebuild terrain is needed specifically for
    lights
    shadows
    grass
    other distributions (maybe? or are they implicitly stable?)

Bottom panel of ZSE/RSE is for filesystem errors

trucks
terrain height
mud
models
plants
distributions
materials
snow depth
*(Wetness)
*(Colorization)
sounds?
overlays
*rivers
*(Water)
*(WaterMud)
river markup
*references

remove "geometric" from elevated overlay and conforming overlay?

Use more Header4 to simplify ToC?
  improve formatting of Header4
    background of light yellowish green?
or increase prominence of header 1 in ToC
  e.g. light green background

the Editor automatically excludes any distribution brushes
  that refer to a plant that doesn't exist
