if snow is drawn on a map improperly (?), _snow.tga might not save
correctly.  The next time the level is opened, trying to draw snow
again will crash the editor.

floating, docked panels

adding a feature and then selecting undo crashes the editor?

Ctrl-Z and Ctrl-Y messages are displayed at the bottom of the main panel

need a general Undo section; this might just be a pointer to other sections:
  undo selected property changes
  undo brush painting
  undo mud (doesn't work)
  restore from archive

U is E-W, V is N-S.

Model - Replace displays the replaced model erratically until one of
the Rebuild options is selected.

Is the editor crashy because I'm abusing it so much, or is it always
crashy?

highlight most useful (non-obvious?) controls (keyboard or mouse)?

During pack, "File not found"
  I had a Sound or SoundDomain that wasn't configured.

DiffLockType: None, Uninstalled, Installed, Always
Torque: default (always on), full (when AWD enabled), none, connectable (w/ upgrade)

CompatibleWheels points to an XML file of possible add-on tires

How to use this book section:
- sequential, or reference, but be sure to read XXX sections first
- editor is not a consumer-level product; it is debugged mostly only to the extent that Saber used its features to create its maps
  - introduction to bug, tips, design considerations
- if you used MudRunner section

Named properties section can be skipped, but it does give some useful
tips, especially for keyboard shortcuts.

Instead of having a section for "Move a Truck, Model, or Plant",
describe only "move a truck" in the "Trucks" section.  Then refer
to this as necessary when describing how to move a model or plant in
those sections.

Every section of the quick start should have a link to the
corresponding full description.  Possibly it should be right at the
top to grab anyone who clicked the wrong section in the table of
contents.

MaxHeight determines the precision of terrain height.
Terrain height pixels can take on 4096 values.
With MaxHeight="512", height resolution is ~0.125m, about 5 inches.
- should only be used when there are no areas of flattish terrain where the user can build up speed
- perfectly flat terrain is OK, e.g. an ice lake
MaxHeight="128" feels more reasonable.
terrain pixels are about 0.5m on a side

when snow is added to a material without a snow_layer, it simply raises the terrain by the height of the "snow"
when snow is added to a material with a snow_layer, it only raises the height of the snow layer
check "Update Material" in the brush dialog to paint snow_layer material along with the snow depth

can cross references be formatted differently?
- separate their text from surrounding text, similar to the Literal style
- make it obvious that it's a link
not automatically, but if I position the cursor ahead of a reference
and select Edit->Fields, I can use the arrow buttons to quickly step
through all references and manually reformat them.  e.g. do this last.

do some materials suppress mud? (extrudes or automatic)

I can run two copies of the SnowRunner editor at once
  any advantage to that?

breakable ice = IsExtrudable
NoGrass prevents grass from distributions
ice_01 and ice_02 have IsSoil="false"

avoid exposed tall cliffs in the terrain height
  they stretch the texture layer and make it look unnatural

can close the brush dialog box and still get its functions via the keyboard

use 'Terrain Brightness' toolbar button to make it easier to see thin
lines for mud

when editing zone_settings.json, make a backup before and after your changes.
if the packing process isn't able to read the JSON file properly, it writes
back a "clean" version with all the data missing that it couldn't read.

zones are randomly ordered in the list on the left of the navigation map.
no way to fix their order.

my guide is more accurate and better tested

icon types:
  travel services
  cargo areas
  objectives
  vehicles
  misc

flat:
rounding radius is the radius (in meters) of the center of the boundary line
  inner radius is rounding radius - thickness/2
  outer radius is rounding radius + thickness/2
minimum thickness is equal to the corner radius
  so the inner radius is never less than half the rounding radius

center of line is inset by thickness
  outer edge is inset by thickness * 1/2

thickness is half the specified thickness
  call it breadth?

effects of terrain height on zone ribbon placement

should garage exit be relatively flat?

hypothesis:
  if an unknown ID starts with the same characters as an existing ID,
    the properties are stolen from that ID *even if it still exists*.
-or-
  if an ID is renamed in the main editor, it communicates this to the zone
    settings editor

Azov 73210 + superheavy semi-trailer = ~36 m long
CAT 770G = < 5 m wide

commit property changes (particular ID naming) before opening the zone editor

spurious new campaign start always selects an empty save slot if there is one.
  recommend leaving one open.

UI_HUD_RECOVERY_NO_ID_IN_EDITOR message when using truck recovery
  is it looking for the map name?

How does "recover" work after a gateway crossing?

keyboad shortcuts for the zone settings editor
  e.g. F2 to edit a property string

all flavors of saddle_high can be locked in the garage and/or it can have a price,
  but it is still available and given for free with purchase of a trailer

all flavors of saddle_low cannot be locked in the garage, and it cannot have a price
  and it is always available and given for free with purchase of a trailer

how to:
  rename a zone
  duplicate a zone

permission denied while packing:
  exit the map in the game

Save in the main editor updates zone_settings.json with any renamed
IDs.  It doesn't touch anything else, including new or deleted zones.
