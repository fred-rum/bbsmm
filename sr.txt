bug reports to snowrunner@saber3d.com

For Steam, create the minimal "getting started" guide and link to the
main PDF, with links both near the top and the bottom.

U is E-W, V is N-S.

Country="RU" or "US"
DiffLockType: None, Uninstalled (upgrade), Installed (yes), Always (always)
Torque: default (always on), full (when AWD enabled), none, connectable (w/ upgrade)
DefaultTire
CompatibleWheels points to an XML file of possible add-on tires

Every section of the quick start should have a link to the
corresponding full description.  Possibly it should be right at the
top to grab anyone who clicked the wrong section in the table of
contents.

can cross references be formatted differently?
- separate their text from surrounding text, similar to the Literal style
- make it obvious that it's a link
not automatically, but if I position the cursor ahead of a reference
and select Edit->Fields, I can use the arrow buttons to quickly step
through all references and manually reformat them.  e.g. do this last.

do some materials suppress mud? (extrudes or automatic)

I can run two copies of the SnowRunner editor at once
  any advantage to that?

breakable ice = IsExtrudable
NoGrass prevents grass from distributions
ice_01 and ice_02 have IsSoil="false"

avoid exposed tall cliffs in the terrain height
  they stretch the texture layer and make it look unnatural

can close the brush dialog box and still get its functions via the keyboard

use 'Terrain Brightness' toolbar button to make it easier to see thin
lines for mud

when editing zone_settings.json, make a backup before and after your changes.
if the packing process isn't able to read the JSON file properly, it writes
back a "clean" version with all the data missing that it couldn't read.

zones are randomly ordered in the list on the left of the navigation map.
no way to fix their order.

should garage exit be relatively flat?

hypothesis:
  if an unknown ID starts with the same characters as an existing ID,
    the properties are stolen from that ID *even if it still exists*.
-or-
  if an ID is renamed in the main editor, it communicates this to the zone
    settings editor

Azov 73210 + superheavy semi-trailer = ~36 m long
CAT 770G = < 5 m wide

commit property changes (particular ID naming) before opening the zone editor

spurious new campaign start always selects an empty save slot if there is one.
  recommend leaving one open.

How does "recover" work after a gateway crossing?

keyboad shortcuts for the zone settings editor
  e.g. F2 to edit a property string

all flavors of saddle_high can be locked in the garage and/or it can have a price,
  but it is still available and given for free with purchase of a trailer

all flavors of saddle_low cannot be locked in the garage, and it cannot have a price
  and it is always available and given for free with purchase of a trailer

permission denied while packing:
  exit the map in the game

recover to garage:
  UI_HUD_RECOVERY_NO_ID_IN_EDITOR
  where should a name be set?
    it's not (Terrain)->Description level->ID

troubleshooting:
  if the navigation map shows a pile of text in the upper left corner and
    hangs, check for two zones with the same ID
  ModMapError.txt when loading the map in the game
    definitely used for:
      invalid truck ID in objective
      invalid zone ID in objective
    but doesn't catch all errors

in cargo reference, list the number of individual logs per load

figure out what can be changed in a mod that people are already playing
  are changes incorporated into an existing game at all?
    yes
  if something collides with the player's truck, can they recover?
  changes in terrain height? (up or down)
  new models that may collide?
  removed models/plants are always safe?
  touch plant distributions could rearrange plants?
  removed objectives that may be in progress?
  changed truck ID that is being used or was already awarded?
  lock or unlock parts
  add or remove maps from region
  change map to region?
  move zones
  change zones used by objectives
  change zone types added by completed objectives
  add or remove objectives? (check completion progress in profile, too)
  add, change, or remove stages from objective
  are updates at mod.io automatically downloaded and used?

what happens when you continue a game where the map has changed
  trucks are at their moved positions?
  revealed map is as saved?
  mud & ruts?
  objectives are as saved?
  map is changed
    what if height has changed under truck(s)?
      truck falls
      does it get stuck in terrain?
    what if model on top of truck?

living area goal type is broken?
  or do I just not know how to set it up?


editor also has recurring bugs that I can't diagnose the source of.
  these aren't documented.

For every property/bitmap, is it possible to categorize them by when
  the Editor notices updates? e.g.
    RO = read only (not editable)
    NV = not visible
    I = immediate,
    RS = after rebuild selected terrain
    RQ = after rebuild terrain (quick)
    RT = rebuild terrain (full)
  if so, include this info with each property declaration
    e.g. right-justified to the right of the declaration
    colored, and as a hyperlink to an explanation
  some visual features don't have an associated property,
    e.g. static shadows for plants
    how to categorize/document those?
  procedural snow
    I (even after model/plant rotation, etc)
  rebuild terrain is needed specifically for
    lights
    shadows
    grass
    other distributions (maybe? or are they implicitly stable?)

Bottom panel of ZSE/RSE is for filesystem errors

how to publish
  put it in a "conclusion" book part (or "wrap up")
  move the "details of the map editor window" in there as well
  map's *.pak file includes files that look relevant, but aren't
    e.g. all images in ui/textures

foreach f2 (`ls {,_dlc/*/}classes/models/*.xml | egrep '[0-9][^/]*_02'`)
  set f1 = `echo $f2 | sed -e 's/_02//' -e 's/.*[/]//g'`
  echo $f1 >> 02.txt
  diff {,_dlc/*/}classes/models/$f1* $f2 >> 02.txt
end

foreach f2 (`ls {,_dlc/*/}classes/models/*.xml | grep '_inst'`)
  set f1 = `echo $f2 | sed -e 's/_inst//' -e 's/.*[/]//g'`
  echo $f2 >> 02.txt
  diff {,_dlc/*/}classes/models/$f1* $f2 >> 02.txt
end

ls {,_dlc/*/}classes/models/*.xml | sed -e s'/^.*[/]\(.*\)[.]xml/\1/' | sort > real.txt
cat /cygdrive/c/Users/Chris/Documents/GitHub/bbsmm/models2.txt | sed -e 's/[ :].*$//' | sort -u > mine.txt
diff mine.txt real.txt  | less


Can weather classes be edited or created?

Use the term "mask" for painted areas?
  but is the "masked" region on or off?

material reference
  allows grass/small plants
  excludes small debris

grass reference
  planting group and min distance
  distributed as non-grass plant (IgnoreNoGrass)
  excluded by thick grass (NotAtThickGrass) (mutually exclusive w/ above?)
  excluded by snow depth (IsAboveSnow)

plant & distribution reference
  behave as grass?
  any unnatural spacing requirement
  max water speed (canes only)
  IsEraseSnow
  EraseBySnowThreshold (as a percentage of plant height)
  distribution:
    snow restrictions
    water restrictions

overlay brush properties:
  Brand
  Interval
  TangentOffset
  AlignToTangent
  AttachPivot
  DirOffset

PlantBrand properties
  DeformTerrain - pushing the "plant" deforms the terrain underneath it
  IsAboveSnow - no obvious effect
  UseDirtTint - unexplored and probably unimportant
  AttachToGround (environment.xml) - looks like a physics thing
  NoTruckCollision - physics thing
  what causes terrain height adjustment?

duplicate an object by dragging it from the Scene View to the main panel.
  but a duplicated plant has weird problems
  properties are mostly duplicated,
    but position is wherever you drag it to,
    and rotation is reset to 0,0,0 (at least for a landed truck)

texture formats:
__d
__d_a
__em_a
__em_d
__n_d
__sh_d
__sh_s
__zo_d

missing texture displays error in texture cache, not actual filename

FadeInStart max is 0.5

are texture sounds not allowed to use single items from a set?

Can custom classes reuse built-in meshes?
  https://file.al/uzrekkb63ujl/CentresNaturistes.rar.html
  <PhysicsModel Mesh="trucks/cargo/cargo_wooden_planks_1">
  if so, cargo can be easily customized per Creating_Custom_Cargo.pdf
  and perhaps others

add descriptions to multi-stage model reference
  e.g. copy from model reference

Format for cargo zone multi-stage buildings?
From Nextej#4477 on Discord:
"modelBuildingSetting": {
  "$type": "ZoneModelBuildingSettings",
  "levelName": "~#@%$`*level_custom_mission_test~#@%$`*",
  "modelTag": "metal_tag",
  "modelType": "METAL",
  "stagesProgress": {
    "state_end": 1,
    "state_start": 0
  }
},

changing an objective sometimes resets it
  is it based on the objective name?

useful ways to edit map XML:
  rename a map
  rebrand a model
  remove a truck add-on
  reorder roads (when drawn on the navigation map)

can watchpoints be usefully opened now?

in grass reference, include use by material by references?
  refer to the material that uses the grass?
  or the reference map that uses the material?

how does highlighting work for a multi-map region?

summarize zone visibility
  driving view:
    when visible
    color
    icon (from property or other)
  navigation map
    when visible
    when labeled
    name (from property or other)
  for many objectives, need separate rows for
    offer zone
      is this the same for all types?
      when unlocked and not completed
        yellow in driving view
        zone name on navigation map and task list
    destination zone
      when it is the current stage's destination

What are the typical rewards from built-in objectives?

discover trailer: 30 xp
discover truck (scout): 100 xp

visit quest: 1050 $, 60 xp
deliver trailer: 1050 $, 130 xp

Do watchpoint cloak the map in their range?

To add bumps to a smooth road:
  Load _tint.tga
    Colors->Components->Extract Component...
      Component RGB Blue (keep other options as default)
      "OK"
    Ctrl-C
  Load _height.png separately
    Layer->New Layer...
      Layer name: bumps
      Mode: Grain Extract (base value - layer value + 128) [clamped]
      Blend space: Auto
      Fill with transparency
    Ctrl-V
    Layer->Anchor Layer (ctrl-H)
    Layer->Mask->Add Layer Mask...
      Grayscale copy of layer
    With the layer mask selected,
      Filters->Blur->Gaussian Blur...
        SizeX/Y = 2
        OK
    Select visual layer (left icon in the visual/mask pair)
    Select only blue/green/alpha channels
    Use paint bucket to paint channels with black
    Select only red/alpha channels
    Windows->Dockable Dialogs->Histogram
    Filters->Noise->Hurl...
      Randomization (%) = 100
      OK
      (histogram is flat)
    Tools->Paint Tools->Smudge
      choose a hard brush, hardness 100
      size ~50
      spacing 1.0 [important!]
      rate ~5 [important!]
      draw from past one tip of the line, along it, and past the other tip
      (histogram is peaked slightly in the middle)
    optional: Filters->Blur->Gaussian Blur...
      SizeX/Y = 0.5 - 1.0
      OK
      (histogram is a strong bell curve)
    Colors->Levels...
      Adjust gray arrow centered below Input Levels until the histogram mean
        is as close to 0.5 as possible.
      OK
      (histogram is centered at 50%, with tails of ~25% on each side)
      (on the other hand, a higher mean value means more dips than hills,
       which could be a good thing)
    right click layer->Edit Layer Attributes... (or directly in the layer box)
      opacity ~1.5%
      (i.e. total bumps of 50% * 1.5% * max_height = 150 =
       1.125 m crest to trough)
    Export As...
